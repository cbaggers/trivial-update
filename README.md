# trivial-update

This is a little library that gives its user tools to easily change *place*
with any supplied function. This library is most useful in cases when you
have do deal with places that have complex structure.

## Installation

Copy files of this library in any place where ASDF can find them. Then you
can use it in system definitions and ASDF will take care of the rest.

Via Quicklisp:

```
(ql:quickload "trivial-update")
```

## Syntax and Description

`update place fn &rest args &environment env`

This macro replaces value at `place` by applying function `fn` to it. Value
at `place` is used as first argument for given function `fn`, other optional
arguments `args` will be used to fill the rest of the argument
list. Parameter `env` is set by Common Lisp implementation during macro
expansion.

If value at `place` should not be put as first argument of given function,
use partial application to pad some arguments. Combination of currying and
`&rest` arguments will give you opportunity to pass old value at `place` on
any position in the argument list.

Remember that keyword parameters are just pairs of normal arguments.
